                    Excited to work in the role of Full Stack Web Developer because it offers me the ability to design, build and maintain websites 
                    from initial concept to production. My previous positions as an IVR developer and Systems Analyst have helped prepare me for this role as
                    theyâ€™ve provided me with experience in working with teams, the application development life cycle and responding to the needs of 
                    the client. I work well in a cross-functional, diverse team-oriented and collaborative environment.
